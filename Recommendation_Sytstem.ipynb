    "The aim of this project is to build a model that provides **top 5 movie recommendations** to a user, based on their **ratings of other movies** from Hulu. Our audience in this case is the **Hulu Technology Team** headed by the *CTO* of Hulu. They are holding a competition to upgrade their current machine learning algorithm that oversees the movie recommendations given to a Hulu subscriber. "

    "Todays streaming landscape is vast and diverse, with over *1 billion users worldwide* and generating over *500 billion dollars* in revenue.  Hulu currently holds *11% of the market share* within the streaming industry, trailing behind *Netflix* with *25% of the market*, *Amazon Prime Video* with *18%*, *HBO Max* with *17%* and *Disney Plus* *with 14%*.  It's also important to note that *85%* of Hulu users are also subscribed to Netflix.  Currently, Hulu uses a *item-based collaborative filtering algorithm*, this is a successful approach commonly used by many recommender systems. This type of recommender system takes into consideration the ratings given to movies and shows by users as the sole source of information for learning to make recommendations. "

Since the syntax of `surprise` and `sklearn` are similar, this made this process much more efficient. This also ensures that the notebook would be readable to anyone with a background in *data science*. We mainly utilized `surprise` to transform the data set to a suitable data format that can be used in *recommendation systems*. We also employed `pickling` to make loading onto any new computer an easier process. "

The `surprise` library uses a form of `SVD` called `Funk's SVD`, the premise behind it is a **matrix factorization-based model**. This means it *transforms* a **user-item matrix** (in our case, a *user-movie ratings matrix*)into latent factor matrices. It is also important to note that errors are *minimized* using `stochastic gradient descent`.  This means that both `regularization` and `learning rate` are `hyper-parameters` that we can tune. Number of `factors` and number of `epochs` are also `hyper-parameters` we tuned."
